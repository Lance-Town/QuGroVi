# QuGroVi
This native iOS app simplifies the self-checkout process by effortlessly scanning barcodes and saving them for easy reference.

- Implemented data storage functionality to keep track of scanned barcodes and quantities in the user's shopping cart.
- Developed an efficient replication algorithm to accurately reproduce scanned barcodes using predefined paths and guidelines.
- Thoroughly tested and compatible with various barcode scanners, ensuring seamless integration.
- Tested to work with any barcode scanner, and I used it to buy some kombucha, specifically <a href="https://gtslivingfoods.com/products/gts-kombucha-guava-goddess">this</a> kombucha.
